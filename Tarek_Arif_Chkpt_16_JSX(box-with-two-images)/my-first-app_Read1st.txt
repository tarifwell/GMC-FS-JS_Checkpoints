Note:
-----

In this directory you will find:
- 1 folder: "my-first-app"
- 1 compressed file: "my-first-app.rar"

The folder contains only the files I worked on, and does not include the React and Bootstrap installation folders.
To use this folder, copy all the files into a React project.

The compressed file is just in case you have problems with the previous folder. In fact, because of the warning message generated by Git when I did "git add"..., I putted original work in an archive to use it when needed.

Thanks.
