Note:
-----

In this directory you will find:
- 1 folder: "my-first-app"

This folder doesn't include React (and Bootstrap) installation folders (node_modules), it contains only files and folders I've used.
To use this folder, copy all the files into a React project.

- 1 compressed file: "my-first-app.rar"

This file include the orignal work.
If the previous folder doesn't work or has some problems, please try the compressed file. 
Problems may occur when doing "git add"... 

Thanks.
